The python for brain imaging (pybrain) workshop series is for practicing neuroimagers
who want to learn more about how to work with data in Python. We assume no previous
Python background, and provide a comprehensive hands-on introduction to state of the art
libraries for experiment building, statistical modelling, machine learning, and
multimodal neuroimaging analysis.

The workshops are hosted by the [MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences
Unit](https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, and will run
online with Zoom. Registration is free and will open soon. 
 
# Schedule

Workshops will run Mondays and Tuesdays, and generally take place 9:30am-12:00pm and
13:00pm-15:30pm GMT. There is separate registration for each workshop, but please do
sign up for Edwin's introductory session if you've never worked with Python before.
