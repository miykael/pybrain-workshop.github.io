The python for brain imaging (pybrain) workshop series is for practicing neuroimagers
who want to learn more about how to work with data in Python. We assume no previous
Python background, and provide a comprehensive hands-on introduction to state of the art
libraries for experiment building, statistical modelling, machine learning, and
multimodal neuroimaging analysis.

The workshops are hosted by the [MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences
Unit](https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, and will run
online with Zoom.
 
# Schedule

Workshops will run Mondays and Tuesdays, and generally take place 9:30am-12:00pm and
13:00pm-15:30pm GMT. There is separate registration for each workshop, but please do
sign up for Edwin's introductory session if you've never worked with Python before.

### Timings

This workshop runs 9:30am - 15:30pm both days. We have breaks scheduled 10:30am-11:00am,
12:00-13:00pm, and 14:00-14:30pm, during which time you may be expected to work
independently on exercises. Please consult the instructions above before the workshop.

Registered attendees will receive an email with the Zoom meeting details. **Please check
your bulk/spam email folders if you are registered and haven't heard from us by now, as
Eventbrite emails often get marked as spam**

#### 2 November
* Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks
* Variables and variable types
* Writing your own functions
* What are classes, and how do I write my own?
* Basic data handling, from loading to plotting

#### 3 November
* Implementing statistical tests
* Model fitting through minimisation
* A quick look at experiments\*
* Using Python at home and/or in the lab

\* While we will be going over how to code experiments, we won't be able to run them in
our online environment. You'll thus have to apply what you learned at a later time.
