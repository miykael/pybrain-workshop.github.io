# Python for brain imaging (PyBrain)
This workshop series is for practicing neuroimagers who want to learn more about how to
work with data in Python. We assume no previous Python background, and provide a
comprehensive hands-on introduction to state of the art libraries for experiment
building, statistical modelling, machine learning, and multimodal neuroimaging analysis.

The workshops are hosted by the [MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences
Unit](https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, and will run
online with Zoom. Registration is free and will open soon. It will be possible to
register separately for each workshop, but please do sign up for the introductory
session if you've never worked with Python before.
